					<p>
						<strong>Freedom SOS</strong> is dedicated to the protection of people who may need emergency services
						no matter where they are. &nbsp;Using the lstest in GPS Technology we have developed a mobile SOS
						service that puts our client in touch with emergency personel. &nbsp;We have 2 monitoring stations
						that are UL listed and monitor 24 hrs a day. &nbsp;We can locate, track and talk directly through
						a small GPS unit that is worn around the neck or our popular watch unit, giving you peace of mind
						that you and loved ones are being looked after.</p>
					<h6></h6>
					<p>
						Society has become extremely mobile and we recognize the need of people to remain independent.
						&nbsp;With our service your loved ones can get their freedom back. &nbsp;They do not have to remain
						home, tied to a land line service, like other emergency services. &nbsp;They have the freedom
						to go anywhere in the US, where service is available, and be monitored at home or on the road.
						&nbsp;Emergencies can happen anywhere at any time.</p>
