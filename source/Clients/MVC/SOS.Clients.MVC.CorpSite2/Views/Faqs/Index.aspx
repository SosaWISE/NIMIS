					<h4>
						Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
					<h6>
						How does it work outside my home?</h6>
					<p>
						The Freedom SOS emergency button combines GPS (Global Positioning Satellite) and
						cellular technology that enables our monitoring station to be notified of your location
						and establish 2-way communication with you. &nbsp;You are not tied to a land line
						for the service to work. &nbsp;A signal is sent through cell towers when you press
						the sos button that will provide 2-way voice contact with the emergency monitoring
						station. &nbsp;It goes with you anywhere. &nbsp;<a href="/Technology">Click here</a>
						for more information on how it works.</p>
					<h6>
						How does it work inside my home?</h6>
					<p>
						Pressing the SOS button will initiate a call to our monitoring center using cellular
						towers. It does not matter if you are home or traveling. The monitoring station
						will be able to talk directly through your unit. &nbsp;If you are not able to talk
						they can continue to monitor you while calling emergency service to your home.</p>
					<h6>
						Do I need a dedicated home phone line to the system to work?</h6>
					<p>
						No. The Freedom SOS system does not require a home phone line and includes all the
						cutting edge GPS and location-based services found. All you need is a cellular signal.</p>
					<h6>
						What is the range of the Pendant/Wrist Help button?</h6>
					<p>
						Whether you use your pendant or wrist button, you have unlimited coverage anywhere
						in the U.S. where there is ATT cellular service.</p>
					<h6>
						Is the Pendant/Wrist button water resistant?</h6>
					<p>
						Yes. It is designed to be worn at all times including in the shower and bath. It
						is not designed to be submerged or exposed to water for a prolonged period of time.</p>
					<h6>
						Will help be sent if I am unable to communicate with, or hear, the operator?</h6>
					<p>
						Yes. If you are unable to communicate with our monitoring center after pressing
						the button, help will be dispatched.</p>
					<h6>
						What emergency services can I get with Freedom SOS?</h6>

					<h6>
						What if I want to be notified if my family should leave their home?</h6>
					<p>
						We have the ability to place an electronic fence, called a geo-fence, around the
						home that if the unit leaves a 100 ft. area, an alarm will be transmitted to the
						monitoring station that can then notify loved ones or emergency authorities. &nbsp;This
						is used for senile patients or anyone requiring extra supervision.</p>
					<h6>
						How much does the service cost?</h6>
					<p>
						Service cost around a dollar a day.</p>
					<h6>
						Can you offer your service to cooperate companies?</h6>
					<p>
						Yes. We work with nursing homes, mental health services and many more. &nbsp;<a href="/ContactUs">Contact
