	/// It explains how the asp.net runtime will call GetRouteData() for every route in the route table.
	/// GetRouteData() is used for inbound url matching, and should return null for a negative match (the current requests url doesn't match the route).
	/// If it does match, it returns a RouteData object describing the handler that should be used for that request, along with any data values (stored in RouteData.Values) that
	/// that handler might be interested in.
	/// 
	/// The book also explains that GetVirtualPath() (used for outbound url generation) is called for each route in the route table, but that is not my experience,
	/// as mine used to simply throw a NotImplementedException, and that never caused a problem for me.  In my case, I don't need to do outbound url generation,
	/// so I don't have to worry about it in any case.
